            <p>My name is Kristian Kottcamp, I am a senior design student at WWU and will be graduating this spring
                quarter. I am originally from Seattle, but moved to Bellingham in 2020 for school. Before attending
                WWU I was a student at WSU in Pullman. WSU's design program wasn't that great and it was very hard 
                for me to live away from the city and my friends. I ended up moving back to Seattle and attended 
                Bellevue College for two quarters to build a portfolio to apply for the WWU design program, which
                luckily I got into.
